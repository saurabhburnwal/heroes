Intro

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
welcome to North Queensland Australia

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
fancy a swim in a tropical paradise you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Crocodiles

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
can't do that here because these

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
crocodiles oh but don't worry they've

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
made a sign you'd think there'd be signs

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Signs

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
everywhere in this tourist hotspot right

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
now

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
it's just the one in slum pictures don't

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
even have any because they made me just

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
use word of mouth around here Oh

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
apparently there's massive prehistoric

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
beasts out there so just take care

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
she'll be right no but your safety is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Safety

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
important so tourists are advised to

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
remain at least 10 metres from the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
water's edge because no crocodile is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
gonna walk 11 metres for a meal right as

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a bonus they've also got stingers

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Stingers

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
doesn't sound too bad though right

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
well actually sting is is just

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Australian for the most deadly marine

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
animal known to mankind but you know

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
stingers is a good name too I mean it's

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
like calling crocodiles nibblers Oh but

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Saltwater crocodiles

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
they've already got a nickname for them

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
they've taken the term saltwater

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
crocodiles dispense with the more

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
integral part of the term you know

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
crocodiles to leave invade colloquialism

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that could be used to describe literally

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
any marine animal so if you're pedaling

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Dolphins

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in the shallows and a local notifies you

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that there's some salties round don't

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
just assume he's talking about dolphins

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or some form of innocuous mollusk

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
because actually he's referring to giant

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
flesh-eating reptiles

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but don't let just this dissuade you

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
they've got other stuff too like the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Other Stuff

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
oldest tropical rainforest in the world

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I just be careful of deadly snakes and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
spiders oh and this bird that may as

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
well be a velociraptor Queensland

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Australia the best part is you only need

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to pay a one-way fare because chances

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
are you won't return

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
